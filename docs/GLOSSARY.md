### 7-Step Agentic Workflow

The core Agentic InfraOps workflow: `requirements` → `architect` → Design Artifacts →
IaC Plan → IaC Code → Deploy → Documentation. Steps 1-3 and 7 are shared;
steps 4-6 diverge into **Bicep track** (`bicep-planner` → `bicep-codegen` → `bicep-deploy`)
or **Terraform track** (`terraform-planner` → `terraform-codegen` → `terraform-deploy`).
Each step produces artifacts in `agent-output/`.
