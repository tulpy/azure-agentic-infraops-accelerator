# Execution Plans

> [Current Version](../../VERSION.md) | Structured plans for multi-step work

Execution plans track significant changes that span multiple steps or sessions.
They provide decision history and progress visibility for both humans and agents.

## What Is an Exec Plan?

A lightweight document that captures the intent, key decisions, and progress of a multi-step
initiative. Not every task needs one — use them for work that:

- Spans multiple files or agent sessions
- Involves architectural decisions worth recording
- Needs progress tracking across interruptions

**Progress**: {checklist}
```

## Lifecycle

1. Create in `active/` when starting multi-step work
2. Update progress checkboxes as work completes
3. Move to `completed/` when all items are done
4. Completed plans serve as decision history for future agent context

## Tech Debt Tracker

The [tech-debt-tracker.md](tech-debt-tracker.md) maintains a running inventory of known quality
gaps, technical debt, and planned remediation. It is updated by the doc-gardening workflow and
referenced by `QUALITY_SCORE.md`.
