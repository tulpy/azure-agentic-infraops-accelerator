this repository. Defines governance invariants and philosophy.

Manages checkpoint recovery and session-state.json schema.

```text
Resume the workflow from step 4 using the existing session state.
```

### workflow-engine

Machine-readable workflow DAG for the 7-step pipeline. Defines node
types, edge conditions, gates, and fan-out patterns.

```text
@workspace Show the workflow graph edges and gate conditions.
```

## :material-robot-outline: Subagents

Subagents are called automatically by the **Bicep CodeGen**, **Terraform CodeGen**,
**Bicep Deploy**, **Terraform Deploy**, **Architect**, and **IaC Planner** agents.
You do not invoke them directly, but understanding their output helps you
interpret validation results.

### bicep-lint-subagent

Runs `bicep lint` and `bicep build` to validate template syntax. Returns a
structured PASS/FAIL result with error counts and details.

### bicep-review-subagent

Reviews Bicep templates against AVM standards, naming conventions, security
baselines, and best practices. Returns an APPROVED, NEEDS_REVISION, or FAILED
verdict with actionable feedback.

### bicep-whatif-subagent

Runs `az deployment group what-if` to preview deployment changes. Analyzes
policy violations, resource changes, and cost impact. Returns a structured
change summary.

### terraform-lint-subagent

Runs `terraform fmt -check`, `terraform validate`, and TFLint to validate
configuration syntax. Returns a structured PASS/FAIL result with diagnostics.

### terraform-review-subagent

Reviews Terraform configs against AVM-TF standards, CAF naming conventions,
security baselines, and governance compliance. Returns APPROVED, NEEDS_REVISION,
or FAILED verdict with actionable feedback.

### terraform-plan-subagent

Runs `terraform plan` to preview infrastructure changes. Classifies resources
into create/update/destroy/replace, highlights destructive operations,
and returns a structured change summary.

### cost-estimate-subagent

Queries Azure Pricing MCP tools for real-time SKU pricing. Compares regions
and returns a structured cost breakdown.

### governance-discovery-subagent

Queries Azure Policy assignments via REST API (including management group-
inherited policies). Classifies policy effects and returns structured governance
constraints.

## :material-lightbulb-group-outline: Tips and Patterns

### Context Priming

!!! tip "Open Files Before Prompting"

    Open relevant artifact files before starting a complex workflow step.
    Copilot uses open files as context, giving agents better awareness of
    your project state.

Before starting a complex workflow, open relevant files so Copilot has context:

1. Open the requirements document (`01-requirements.md`)
2. Open the architecture assessment (`02-architecture-assessment.md`)
3. Then ask the Bicep Planner agent to create the implementation plan

### Chaining Agents

You can chain agents manually by using handoff buttons in the chat, or run
the Conductor for automatic orchestration. Manual chaining gives you more
control over each step.

**Bicep track**:

1. Run **Requirements** → review and approve `01-requirements.md`
2. Run **Architect** → review WAF scores and cost estimate
3. Run **Bicep Planner** → review governance constraints and plan
4. Run **Bicep CodeGen** → review generated templates
5. Run **Bicep Deploy** → review what-if before approving deployment
6. Run **As-Built** → generate post-deployment documentation

**Terraform track**:

1. Run **Requirements** → review and approve `01-requirements.md`
2. Run **Architect** → review WAF scores and cost estimate
3. Run **Terraform Planner** → review governance constraints and plan
4. Run **Terraform CodeGen** → review generated configs
5. Run **Terraform Deploy** → review plan output before applying
6. Run **As-Built** → generate post-deployment documentation

### Recovering from Errors

If an agent produces incorrect output, use specific follow-up prompts:

```text
The VNet address space conflicts with our on-premises range (10.0.0.0/8).
Change the hub VNet to 172.16.0.0/16 and spoke VNets to 172.17.0.0/16.
```

### Working with Existing Infrastructure

Agents can work with existing deployments, not just greenfield projects:

```text
I have an existing resource group rg-legacy-app-prod with 15 resources.
Generate as-built documentation for this infrastructure.
```

```text
Review the existing Bicep templates in infra/bicep/legacy-app/
and suggest improvements for WAF alignment.
```
