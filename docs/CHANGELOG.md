## [0.10.0] — Unreleased

### Added

- feat(skills): add `workflow-engine` skill with machine-readable DAG (`workflow-graph.json`)
  for graph-based step routing in the Conductor, replacing hardcoded step logic.
- feat(skills): add `context-shredding` skill with 3-tier runtime compression
  (`full`/`summarized`/`minimal`) and per-artifact compression templates.
- feat(session-resume): upgrade session state schema from v1.0 → v2.0 with atomic claim-based
  lock model (`lock.owner_id`, `lock.heartbeat`, `lock.attempt_token`), per-step `claim` objects,
  `stale_threshold_ms`, and `event_log` audit trail. Backwards-compatible with v1.0 files.
- feat(skills): add circuit breaker pattern to `iac-common` skill with failure taxonomy
  (6 categories), anomaly detection thresholds, and mandatory stopping rules for deploy agents.
- feat(skills): add Smart PR Flow to `github-operations` skill with label-based lifecycle
  tracking, auto-label rules, and deploy agent watchdog integration.
- feat(config): add `.github/agent-registry.json` — machine-readable registry mapping agent
  roles to definition files, default models, and required skills.
- feat(config): add `.github/skill-affinity.json` — skill/agent affinity catalog with
  `primary`/`secondary`/`never` weights for context budget optimization.
- feat(scripts): add 5 new validators: `validate-session-lock`, `validate-workflow-graph`,
  `validate-agent-registry`, `validate-skill-affinity`, `validate-docs-sync`;
  validator count 22 → 27.
- feat(hooks): add `pre-push` hook to `lefthook.yml` with diff-based domain routing;
  only runs validators for changed file types, in parallel.
- feat(scripts): add `diff-based-push-check.sh` helper for pre-push hook domain detection.

### Changed

- refactor(conductor): replace hardcoded step table with graph-based routing via
  `workflow-graph.json` and agent registry lookups.
- refactor(conductor): add circuit breaker principle — halt on `blocked` step status.
- refactor(agents): add `context-shredding` skill reference to Architect, Bicep CodeGen,
  Terraform CodeGen, and As-Built agents for runtime context compression.
- refactor(agents): add `iac-common/references/circuit-breaker.md` and Smart PR Flow
  references to Bicep Deploy and Terraform Deploy agents.
- refactor(instructions): add runtime compression and skill affinity sections to
  `context-optimization.instructions.md`.

### Fixed

- fix(session-state): accept both schema_version `"1.0"` and `"2.0"` in validator
  for backwards compatibility.
